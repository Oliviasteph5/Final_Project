##  Data Science End to End Project: The development of a comprehensive water quality monitoring and prediction system.

#### Introduction
This README file provides an overview of a  Data Science project plan focused on the development of a comprehensive water quality monitoring and prediction system. The dataset used for this project consists of 10 features and 2011 rows

#### Dataset Information
- Multivariate: dataset involves observations or samples with more than one variable or feature.
- Subject Area: environment, healthcare, public health, sustainability.
- Feature Type: boolean.

#### Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project is to predict the drinkability of water in real time.

- Water Potability Classification: Predict the potability of water based on various water quality parameters 
- Data Exploration: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distribution, patterns, and relationships within the dataset.
- Visualization: Implement a visualization tool to present the insights.

#### Data Source and Composition
The dataset is a combination of synthetic data generated using the Weka tool and the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) filter (77%), along with direct data collected from users through a web platform (23%).

#### Planning of the project
** DAY 1
1. Acquire the dataset.
2. Download the dataset from the source.
3. Verify the dataset format and structure.
4. Load the dataset into a data frame (e.g., pandas DataFrame in Python).

** DAY 2
1. Data wrangling.
2. Display basic information (e.g., number of rows, columns, data types).
3. Decide on a strategy for handling missing data (e.g., imputation or removal). Implement the chosen strategy.
4. Stating hypothesis.

** DAY 3
1. Plot histograms for numerical variables to understand their distributions.
2. Create bar charts for categorical variables.
3. Create several classification models and cross validate to check for accuracy
4. Working on visaulizations and getting insights.


** DAY 4 
1. Make conclusions.
2. Work on the presentation.
3. Prepare for presentation.
